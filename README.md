# CS50 Finance Project Readme


Welcome to the CS50 Finance project! This project is an exciting venture into the world of web development, databases, and financial interactions. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or just getting started, this application will give you hands-on experience in building a stock trading platform.

## Project Overview

CS50 Finance is a web application that lets you immerse yourself in the virtual world of stock trading. You'll have the power to register, log in, view real-time stock prices, buy and sell stocks, and even review your transaction history. We've built this application using Flask for the backend, SQLite to handle the database, and HTML/CSS to create the user interface.

## Usage

Let's dive into how you can make the most out of CS50 Finance:

### 1. Registration and Login

To start your stock trading journey, you'll need to create an account. Head over to the registration page and provide your details. Once registered, you can log in using your credentials anytime you return to the application.

### 2. Getting Stock Quotes

Before you buy or sell stocks, it's important to know their current prices. The "Quote" feature comes in handy here. Simply enter the stock symbol you're interested in, and we'll fetch the real-time price for you. This will give you the information you need to make informed decisions.

### 3. Buying Stocks

Ready to make your first investment? The "Buy" functionality lets you purchase shares of a stock. Just enter the stock symbol and the number of shares you want to buy. We'll handle the calculations, deduct the amount from your virtual balance, and add the stocks to your portfolio.

### 4. Selling Stocks

Have some stocks you want to part with? The "Sell" feature allows you to sell the stocks you own. Provide the stock symbol and the number of shares you wish to sell. The application will update your portfolio and give you a new balance based on the sale price.

### 5. Transaction History

As you trade stocks, you might want to keep track of your activities. The "History" section provides you with a clear view of all your transactions, including both buy and sell actions. This way, you can review your progress and decisions over time.
